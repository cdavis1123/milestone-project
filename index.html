        <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>My journey into the tech world started when I realized my career was a dead end.
            I was unhappy and realized I was the only one that could change that, and it required
            swift actions. I was fortunate enough that I could just walk away and focus on finding
            what that next "thing" was for me. My father was a computer programer before he retired
            and that is what got me started looking into the tech field aside from the stability
            of the field to take me into my retirement some day. I started research into
            what that could be and came across skillcrush!</p>

            <h3>HTML5 &amp;CSS Website</h3>
            <p>Creation of a website working off a photoshop comp. Working on this
            website made me appreciate writing code and realized that the key
          to learning code is repetitive code writing. My favortie part about writing
        code for this was working through the learning curve of being new to the code
      world.  </p>
